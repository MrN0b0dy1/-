                When Was DC Comics Created?
           </h2>
           <p>
                 The first iteration of DC Comics was founded in 1934. But who invented DC Comics? Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson.  

                At the time, the company wasn’t called DC comics. The original company name was National Allied Publications. Wheeler-Nicholson didn’t have lofty goals for the company; he simply wanted to make a profit on the popular pulp comic market. 
                In February of 1935, National Allied launched its first publication New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine #1. This was successful enough for them to issue their next comic series in December of the following year: New Comics #1. 
                You may be wondering, "what does DC stand for in DC Comics?" or "Where did the name come from?" Well, in 1936, National Allied Publications was ready to release its third series, Detective Comics. But cash flow issues caused the first publication of the crime anthology to be delayed until March 1937. At this point, Wheeler-Nicholson was facing serious debt problems. As a result, he was forced to take on a partner to launch the detective comics series. 
                His partner, Harry Donefeld, was also a pulp magazine publisher and distributor. This merger led to the founding of Detective Comics Inc. Eventually, Donefeld forced Wheeler-Nicholson out of the company by buying out the rest of National Allied Publications.

            <h2>Enter the Superhero</h2>
            <p>
                By 1938, Detective Comics Inc. was ready to launch its fourth title known as Action Comics. The first issue was written and illustrated by two men: Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. 
                In June of 1938, Action Comics #1 was released, featuring a new type of comic book character archetype, the superhero. There on the cover, holding a car over his head, was none other than the Man of Steel himself—Superman. 
                This DC character changed everything. 
                American teens went crazy for this exciting new superhero genre and story character, being drawn in by the action and real life feel of the comic. The introduction of Superman's daily life as Clark Kent and his love interest Lois Lane captured the hearts of many. Issues flew off the shelf. Practically overnight, Superman and Action Comics became a sales sensation. This surge in interest for the superhero genre was what inspired other superhero comic book companies to emerge, such as Marvel, which, ‘til today, sparks debate between whether Marvel or DC Comics is better.
                Although many may have forgotten this today, the Adventure Comics series went on to become one of the longest and most successful runnings in DC history. Its final issue (#503) was published in 1983.

            <h2>
                The Golden Age of Comics 
            </h2>
            <p>
                The ‘40s was considered to be the Golden Age of comics. Over the next decade, National Comics Publications continued to expand on the lore of superheroes. They delved further into their mainstays while also introducing new superheroes like the Sandman. 
                Throughout the decade, the comic book industry boomed. For many Americans, it brought a sense of unity and hope, especially in the midst of a second world war. And comics helped push wartime propaganda—DC even had Superman join the fray, in print.
                In 1946, National Allied Publications merged with Detective Comics, Inc., forming National Comics Publications. Also, during this time, the company began aggressively fighting copyright violating “imitations” of their now-iconic heroes by other publishers with characters like Wonder Man and Captain Marvel. 
                By the late ‘40s, the popularity of superheroes began to fade. As a result, National Comics Publications began focusing on other comic genres such as Westerns, crime, humor, and Sci-Fi. That said, several of their more popular superhero comic series continued to publish.

                DC Today 
            </h2>
            <p>
                The next few decades saw an ebb and flow of the popularity of DC. Over the years, comic book sales continued to drop as the medium fell out of favor. Despite that, the company was buoyed by their superhero IP, which they leveraged into cartoons, film, and video game titles, creating DC entertainment. 
                Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy—based on Frank Miller’s limited series—helped DC regain its pop-cultural relevance and led to a resurgence in comic book sales. 
                This was followed by several DC films distributed by Warner Bros, including a Justice League team-up, directed by Zack Snyder. 
                Today, Batman, Superman, and the rest of the hero pantheon are alive and well, joined by a cast of exciting new heroes, villains, worlds, and adventures in the DC extended universe. The most recent focus has been on DC Future State in which: “The Multiverse has been saved from the brink of destruction, but the triumph of DC’s heroes has shaken loose the very fabric of time and space!” Keep an eye out for Justice League Dark because of this!
